# Hub model tasks configuration  

Every Hub is organized around "modeling tasks" that are defined to meet the needs of a project. Modeling tasks are defined for a hub in the `tasks.json` file, which specifies the model tasks (task ids and targets) as well as model output types. A detailed definition of modeling tasks can be found here.
