# Key definitions

```{admonition} Modeling hub
a consortium of research groups working together on a common set of modeling tasks, with the goal of developing ensemble models to provide stakeholders with a single model output representing uncertainty across different modeling assumptions and frameworks.
```

```{admonition} Task
a definition of the goals of a modeling effort, possibly including conditions, assumptions, and targets. Some tasks are relatively fixed, as for forecast hubs that regularly predictions for a set time horizon in the near-term future. Other tasks may be more variable, as for scenario hubs that model differing hypothetical futures.
```

```{admonition} Team 
a group of individuals developing modeling software to generate models in response to tasks coordinated by modeling hubs.
```

```{admonition} Mathematical Model formulation/structure
a statistical or mathematical formulation of a model.
```

```{admonition} Modeling software
Code that implements the modeling strategy used by a team to generate model outputs. Each team may have multiple instances of software.
```

```{admonition} Model output 
A set of target results generated in response to some modeling task. A model might be the result of a single teamâ€™s response to the task, or it might be an ensemble of results representing outcomes of multiple efforts
```

```{admonition} Nowcast
model output that provides estimates/predictions of partially observed or unobserved values at the current date from a data stream prior to the current date. Nowcasts should be set up so that they can be evaluated for accuracy based on comparisons with the eventually observed complete data.
```

```{admonition} Forecast
a specific quantified prediction of an observable event or trend that has not yet been observed, conditional on data that has been observed up to a specified time. Forecasts should be set up so that they can be evaluated for accuracy based on comparisons with the eventual observed data.
```

```{admonition} Scenario
a description of a possible future to be modeled, described in terms of models parameters that might be varied, such as transmissibility, vaccine adoption, vaccine efficacy, the emergence of a new variant, etc.
```

```{admonition} Scenario projection
model output that provides estimates of future observations of future trends conditional on specific assumptions about a given scenario. Scenario projects are challenging to evaluate against future observed data since the assumptions under which scenarios were generated likely will never have been exactly met.
```
