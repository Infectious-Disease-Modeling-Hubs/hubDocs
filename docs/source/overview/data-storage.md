# Data storage

There are three supported options for data storage/archival.

## [`GitHub repositories`](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories)  

GitHub is an online software development platform. It's used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects. Itâ€™s free, easy to use, and has become central in the movement toward open-source software.


## [`AWS buckets`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html)  

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Customers of all sizes and industries can use Amazon S3 to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics. Amazon S3 provides management features so that you can optimize, organize, and configure access to your data to meet your specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements.


## [`Zoltar`](https://zoltardata.com/about) 

Designed to improve the robustness of forecasting research, Zoltar is a research data repository that stores forecasts made by external models in standard formats and provides tools for validation, visualization, and scoring. It builds off of a foundation of core ideas and data structures first introduced in 2019 by predx. Zoltar can host real-time or retrospective forecasting challenges, competitions, or research projects, with users specifying the forecast targets.

In June 2020, we released a preprint describing the concepts, data model, and intended scope of Zoltar.

Please visit the Zoltar documentation site for more information, along with guides for users, researchers, and developers. We have an API that supports programmatic push and pull access to forecast data, including forecasts themselves, and model metadata. We have also developed zoltr, an R package, and zoltpy, a Python library, to facilitate accessing the Zoltar API and the underlying forecast data.
