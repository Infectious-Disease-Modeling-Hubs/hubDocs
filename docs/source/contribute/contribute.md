# How to contribute

The Consortium of Infectious Disease Modeling Hubs built _the hubverse_ collaboratively and we benefit from your contributions.  

## Use and test our software and tools  

The hubverse was created for teams to easily create and set-up collaborative modeling hubs, and we benefit from having groups use these tools and tell us about it.  

## File issues  

Let us know if something is not working for you or if something could improve. This could be a bug in the code, a case where the tools are not appropriate for your use case, a problem with the documentation, or something else. Issues can be filed [here](https://github.com/Infectious-Disease-Modeling-Hubs/hubDocs/issues).
