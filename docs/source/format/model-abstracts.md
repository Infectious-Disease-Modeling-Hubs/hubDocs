# Model abstracts

## Directory structure
The `model-abstracts` directory in a modeling hub is an optional feature, but if included, it must have the following subdirectory and file structure:
* `team1-modela`
   * `<round-id1>.md`
   * `<round-id2>.md`
* `team1-modelb`
   * `<round-id1>.md`
* `team2-modela`
   * `<round-id1>.md`

There is one directory for each team and within that, possibly multiple files, one for each round.

## Purpose

The `model-abstracts` directory is an optional feature of a hub that may be useful to keep track of round-specific updates to the metadata, e.g. describing modeling assumptions specific to one modeling round. Note: as part of a separate workflow, hubs may find it helpful to associate round-specific metadata with the corresponding model output files.
