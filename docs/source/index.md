This site provides information regarding the requirements for using 
the infrastructure that our collaborative group has set up to build
and use collaborative modeling hubs.

**Example hubs** include the [US COVID-19 Forecast Hub](https://covid19forecasthub.org/) 
and the [US COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub](https://covid19scenariomodelinghub.org/).
