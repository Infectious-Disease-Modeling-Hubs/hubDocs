# Modeling Hub documentation

```{caution}
This project is under active development.
```

**The Consortium of Infectious Disease Modeling Hubs** is a collaboration of research teams that have built and maintained predictive modeling hubs for infectious disease applications. Working together, we have developed software for groups that are running collaborative modeling hub efforts. This website documents the requirements for using the infrastructure that the Consortium has set up.  

The [overview](overview/who-we-are.md) section provides an introduction to the project, and the [getting started](overview/getting-started.md) section outlines how to set up a working hub, as well as the different resources created by this project.
