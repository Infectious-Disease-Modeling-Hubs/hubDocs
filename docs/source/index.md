# The Consortium of Infectious Disease Modeling Hubs documentation

This site provides information regarding the requirements for using 
the infrastructure that our collaborative group has set up to build
and use collaborative modeling hubs.

**Example hubs** include the [US COVID-19 Forecast Hub](https://covid19forecasthub.org/) 
and the (US COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub)[https://covid19scenariomodelinghub.org/].

Check out the {doc}`usage` section for further information, including
