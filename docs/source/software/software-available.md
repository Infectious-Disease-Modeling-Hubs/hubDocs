# Software

To assist users in building a hub, we have developed a software suite with specific functions and uses outlined below. These tools are designed to support common modeling hub tasks, like loading model output data, plotting the model output data, building ensembles using the data, and in some cases evaluating the predictions made by different models.  

## [`hubUtils`](https://github.com/Infectious-Disease-Modeling-Hubs/hubUtils)  

The goal of `hubUtils` is to provide a set of utility functions for downloading, plotting, and scoring forecast and truth data from Infectious Disease Modeling Hubs. You can find the complete package and instructions for use [here](https://github.com/Infectious-Disease-Modeling-Hubs/hubUtils).  

## [`hubEnsembles`](https://github.com/Infectious-Disease-Modeling-Hubs/hubEnsembles)  

`hubEnsembles` is an R package with functionality to build simple ensembles of data from modeling hubs. Different ensembles can be built using for instance the mean, median, and mode. You can find the complete package and instructions for use [here](https://github.com/Infectious-Disease-Modeling-Hubs/hubEnsembles).  

## [`hubValidations`](https://github.com/Infectious-Disease-Modeling-Hubs/hubValidations)  

The `hubValidations` repository facilitates the implementation of general validation rules that are enforced on submissions in the form of pull requests to hub repositories. You can find the complete package and instructions for use [here](https://github.com/Infectious-Disease-Modeling-Hubs/hubValidations).  

## [`hubTemplate`](https://github.com/Infectious-Disease-Modeling-Hubs/hubTemplate)

The `hubTemplate` repository provides a template for groups wishing to build and maintain a new modeling hub, in the style of the [US COVID-19 Forecast Hub](https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub), the [US Scenario Modeling Hub](https://github.com/midas-network/covid19-scenario-modeling-hub) or the [European COVID-19 Forecast Hub](https://github.com/covid19-forecast-hub-europe/covid19-forecast-hub-europe). You can find the complete package and instructions for use [here](https://github.com/Infectious-Disease-Modeling-Hubs/hubTemplate).
